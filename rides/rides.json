These high mountain passes are extremely volatile when it comes to the weather. The color in the video might be off as it is on many mid-day overcast mountain shoots. You'll see hints of the sun here and there but I was able to complete the video just before a major downpour. \nThis route is very difficult by bike due to high traffic, narrower road, and steep grades, but is a beautiful mountain road on most days.
